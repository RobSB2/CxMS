# [Project Name] - Technical Exceptions & Workarounds

**Template Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Document technical exceptions, workarounds, and special handling
**Created:** [DATE]
**Last Updated:** [DATE]
**Total Exceptions:** [X]

---

## Overview

This document tracks technical exceptions to standard patterns, workarounds for edge cases, and special handling required. These are intentional deviations that should be preserved and understood.

**Why track exceptions?**
- Prevent "fixing" intentional workarounds
- Understand why code deviates from patterns
- Know when exceptions can be removed
- Help future developers (and AI) understand the codebase

## Guidelines for Adding Exceptions

1. **Document immediately** - Don't wait, document when you add the workaround
2. **Be specific** - Include exact code/config, not vague descriptions
3. **Explain the "why"** - Future developers need to understand the reasoning
4. **Set review triggers** - Define when to revisit
5. **Link related items** - Connect to decisions, issues, other exceptions
6. **Keep it current** - Update when circumstances change
