# [PROJECT] Session Startup

**CxMS Version:** 1.5
**Template Version:** 1.1
**Purpose:** Single prompt to initialize a fully-contextualized session
**Usage:** "Read [PROJECT]_Startup.md and follow its instructions"

---

## Startup Sequence

Execute these steps in order:

### 1. Read Core Files
Read these files completely (in this order):
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview, tech stack, conventions
- `[PROJECT]_Approvals.md` - Pre-approved operations (DO NOT prompt for these)
- `[PROJECT]_Session.md` - Current state, last session, what's in progress
- `[PROJECT]_Tasks.md` - Active and pending tasks

### 2. Read Context Files (if they exist)
- `[PROJECT]_Context.md` - Architecture and documentation index
- `[PROJECT]_Prompt_Library.md` - Prompt patterns that work well

### 3. Check Parent CxMS (if convention questions arise)
<!-- Update path if using parent reference -->
Parent templates at: `[path to parent CxMS]/templates/`

### 4. Check Context Status
If `.claude/context-status.json` exists, read it to get your current context usage:
```bash
cat .claude/context-status.json
```
Monitor `ctx_pct` throughout the session. Alert user if it exceeds 75%.

### 5. Check Telemetry Consent
Check if `.cxms/telemetry-consent.json` exists:
- **If missing:** Ask user once: "CxMS can send anonymous usage metrics to help improve the system. Enable telemetry? (You can revoke anytime)"
  - If yes: Run `node [path-to-tools]/cxms-report.mjs --consent`
  - If no: Run `node [path-to-tools]/cxms-report.mjs --revoke`
- **If exists with `consented: true`:** Note for session end (will auto-submit)
- **If exists with `consented: false`:** Skip telemetry entirely

### 6. Provide Session Summary

After reading, provide this summary (include telemetry status):

```
## Session Ready

**Project:** [PROJECT NAME]
**Context:** [X]% used (from context-status.json, or "unknown" if not available)
**Last Session:** [date from Session.md]
**Last Accomplishments:** [bullet points]

**Current State:**
- [key status items]

**Active Tasks:**
- [from Tasks.md]

**Pre-Approved:** [summary from Approvals.md]
**Always Ask:** [destructive operations from Approvals.md]

**Telemetry:** [Enabled - will auto-submit at session end | Disabled | Not configured]

**Suggested Next Action:** [based on tasks and state]

Awaiting instructions.
```

### 7. Apply Approvals

For the remainder of this session:
- Do NOT prompt for operations listed in [PROJECT]_Approvals.md
- DO prompt for anything marked "ALWAYS ASK"
- When in doubt, check [PROJECT]_Approvals.md before prompting

---

## Quick Start (Copy-Paste)

```
Read [PROJECT]_Startup.md and follow its instructions.
```

---

## Session End Reminder

Before ending:
1. Update `[PROJECT]_Session.md` - Current state
2. Update `[PROJECT]_Tasks.md` - Mark completed, add new
3. **If telemetry consented:** Run `node [path-to-tools]/cxms-report.mjs --auto`
4. Commit changes if work was done
