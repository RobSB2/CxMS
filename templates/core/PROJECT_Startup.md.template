# [PROJECT] Session Startup

**CxMS Version:** 1.5
**Template Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Single prompt to initialize a fully-contextualized session
**Usage:** "Read [PROJECT]_Startup.md and follow its instructions"

---

## Startup Sequence

Execute these steps in order:

### 1. Read Core Files
Read these files completely (in this order):
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview, tech stack, conventions
- `[PROJECT]_Approvals.md` - Pre-approved operations (DO NOT prompt for these)
- `[PROJECT]_Session.md` - Current state, last session, what's in progress
- `[PROJECT]_Tasks.md` - Active and pending tasks

### 2. Read Context Files (if they exist)
- `[PROJECT]_Context.md` - Architecture and documentation index
- `[PROJECT]_Prompt_Library.md` - Prompt patterns that work well

### 3. Check Parent CxMS (if convention questions arise)
<!-- Update path if using parent reference -->
Parent templates at: `[path to parent CxMS]/templates/`

### 4. Provide Session Summary

After reading, provide this summary:

```
## Session Ready

**Project:** [PROJECT NAME]
**Last Session:** [date from Session.md]
**Last Accomplishments:** [bullet points]

**Current State:**
- [key status items]

**Active Tasks:**
- [from Tasks.md]

**Pre-Approved:** [summary from Approvals.md]
**Always Ask:** [destructive operations from Approvals.md]

**Suggested Next Action:** [based on tasks and state]

Awaiting instructions.
```

### 5. Apply Approvals

For the remainder of this session:
- Do NOT prompt for operations listed in [PROJECT]_Approvals.md
- DO prompt for anything marked "ALWAYS ASK"
- When in doubt, check [PROJECT]_Approvals.md before prompting
