# [PROJECT] - Prompt Library

**Template Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Curated prompt engineering reference and training resource
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

---

## Overview

This library captures **significant prompts** with analysis and improvement suggestions. Unlike Prompt History (which logs all prompts), this library focuses on learning and optimization.

**Use this library to:**
- Learn effective prompting patterns
- Reference successful prompts for similar tasks
- Train team members on prompt engineering
- Track your prompt engineering growth over time

## Prompt Patterns Reference

### Pattern: Context-First
```
Read [files] to understand [context], then [action].
```
**When to use:** Starting sessions, complex tasks requiring background

### Pattern: Constraint-Bounded
```
[Action] with these constraints:
- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2
Output format: [specify]
```
**When to use:** When specific requirements must be met

### Pattern: Iterative Refinement
```
First, show me [draft/outline/approach].
Wait for my feedback before [implementing/continuing].
```
**When to use:** Complex or risky changes, learning new domains

### Pattern: Research-Then-Act
```
Search for [topic], summarize findings, then recommend [action].
```
**When to use:** When you need information before deciding

### Pattern: Multi-Step Explicit
```
Complete these steps in order:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
Confirm each step before proceeding to the next.
```
**When to use:** Complex workflows, critical operations

## Common Improvements

| Weak Pattern | Strong Pattern | Example |
|--------------|----------------|---------|
| "Fix the bug" | "Fix the bug in [file] where [symptom]. The expected behavior is [X]." | Adds location, symptom, expected outcome |
| "Make it better" | "Improve [specific aspect] by [specific action]. Success criteria: [X]." | Adds measurable goal |
| "Help me with X" | "I need to [goal]. Current state: [X]. Constraints: [Y]. Suggest approach." | Adds context and constraints |
| "Do the thing we discussed" | "Implement [specific feature] as outlined in [file/previous discussion point]." | Adds explicit reference |
| "Update the docs" | "Update [specific doc] to reflect [specific change]. Match existing style." | Adds scope and style guidance |

## Quick Reference Card

**Session Start:**
```
Read CLAUDE.md and [PROJECT]_Session.md, summarize current state, await instructions.
```

**Before Complex Task:**
```
Before starting, outline your approach for [task]. Wait for approval.
```

**End of Session:**
```
Update [PROJECT]_Session.md with current state, mark completed tasks, note blockers.
```

**When Stuck:**
```
I'm trying to [goal] but encountering [problem].
I've tried: [approaches].
Constraints: [limitations].
Suggest alternatives.
```
